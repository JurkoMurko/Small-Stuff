# Project Ideas

## DEATH

- [ ] turret
- [ ] remote controll gun

## Vehicles/motor stuff

- submarine (maybe a life size one too)
- car (something like mouse trap car maybe)
- plane
- coppter

## SOMETHING WITH ROCKET ENGINE

- [ ] rocket engine eggdrop (like a suacide burn but for egg)
- [ ] helicopter egg drop first
- [ ] deployable parashute

## AI

- [ ] ocr
- [ ] computer vision (to get location)
(kinda like tesla self driving just not at all cuz bruuuh)
- [ ] charecter recognition like humans (people from two writng systems can look at the same charecter and see different things, also we read words not just charecters)

## Other

- [ ] thing that lets you make md lists

(FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACCURATLY GET THE POS OF SOMEHING IRL)
vr tracker thing that machael reeves used for surgery robot

## Tech to learn

- motorized blades moving through liquids
  - wind turbinds
  - boat propellers
  - hellicopter propellers
- engines
  - rocket englines
- exolosives

## Other things I could learn

- how sonar, radar, and lidar work like so I could build one
- how bluetooth tracking works
- I need a list of position tracking tech
  - bluetooth
  - wireless tracking w/ ultra wide band
  - rfid tracking???
  - cameras on vehicle
  - cameras on walls like vr
  - gps
  - distance sonar sensor maybe
  - accelerometer + gyroscope
  - remembering what we've done before like how much the wheels turned and what our environment looks like

## Things stopping me

- mouse control for opengl
- a good boom that's easy to light
- just don't have the stuff to make rocket
- position system for garbage boi
- don't know shit about propellers
- don't know how to use python serial on a laptop
- I need money to buy supplies
