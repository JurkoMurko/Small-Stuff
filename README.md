# All my personal random little projects
## Over the years I've learned on and made a lot of small projects that I didn't feel deserved a stand alone folder so I kept the all todether

**The projects so far are:**
* **Arduino** (Very simple electronics projects)
* **C** (Basically nothing. I tried learning twice but I run into problems)
* **dataVisualisation** (No Idea, maybe I was learning graphs. I wrote this years ago)
* **fileAutomation** (experamenting with file manipulation in Python w/ os module)
* **Knife bot** (Using a 3D printed mount, my moms small kitchen knife, and some tape, I made a little bot that I could move the knife with my laptops trackpad)
* **Learning Websites** (What I made following various tutorials trying to learn to make websites (static, dynamic, JS + Express, Py + Flask, etc/idr))
* **Monty Carlo** (This classic problem didn't feel right to my head to I simulated it and my intuition was wrong)
* **Open GL** (I got interested in rendering something to the screen and spend way too long figuring out how the math for a procedurally gennerated cude by hand in the spare time in my HS Algebra 2 class. This took me about to weeks to make a elegent function for just to realize it is more efficient to hard code the points and vectors in memeory like my tutorial started with)
* **optimazation** (Yeah IDK--something to do with the fibonacci sequence?)
* **RC_Car** (used a RaspberryPi and a $10 rc car from walmart to create a robot car)
* **React Tutorial** (is self explainatory)
* **Scrapping** (various data scrapping from the internet Note: rather successful and useful)
* **send Email** (learned how to use python to send emails)
* **send SMS** (duh)
* **Simple Games** (these were some of my first projects that taught me to code:python i was following tutorials obv. I also made the game of life from scratch a few years later.)
* **tiny** (tiny things that I made while learning or to do something faster than by hand)
* **txt to string for pedo** (My friend made a program to create handwritten looking stuff automatically. He asked for my help with bugs and stuff)
